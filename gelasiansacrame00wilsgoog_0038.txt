evidently to he found in the form for the Benedictio cerei, which
finds its natural place in the section relating to Easter Even,
but is shown, hythe rubric which follows it ¹, to have hoen
drawn, not from a Liber sacramenrorum, but from some docu-
ment corresponding to an ‘Exulet Roll’ It is right also to
notice here the fact, which is pointed out by M. Duchesne ¹,
that, among what may be called the Pontifical sections of this
book, the series of forms relating to the minor Orders contained
in sections xcv and xcvi are not of Roman origin, and that
certain forms rerating to the ordination of Dcacons and Priests
are also probably drawn from a Gallican source But it seems
certain that the basis of the first part of the'book‚ containing
the services for the Church year from Christmas to Pentecost,
has been a Roman Sacramentary of early date. Here and there
we may find indications that the Roman book has been adapted
to Gallicas usages, in the use of the phrase ‘post clausum
Paschae,’ in the absence of any reference to the Roman
‘Stations,' and perhaps in the presence, in the missae of christ·
mas and Eastertide, of prayers which seem to have the charac-
teristics of Gallican rather than of Roman collects, and of other
prayers which are found in the Gallican Sacramentaries The
Roman book employed by the compilor was probably of a date
earlier than 7 31, since there are no massae for the Thursdays of
Lent, while we know that the ‘Stations’ on these days were
established hy Gregory 11 (715-7 31) ⁸. On the other hand, the
presence of massae for the Wednesday‚ Friday and Satnrday
before the first Sunday of Lent seems to point to a date later
than S. Gregory the Great for the Roman book, while the pre·
sence of a Capitulum S. Gregorii Papae in section xxi makes
it quite clear that the present arrangement of the text belongs
to a date not earlier than the year 600.

The second book contains not only metrae for the Saints’
Days‚ hut also certain sections which would seem properly to
belong to the series contained in the first book, namely, the messae
for the September and ¹December Ember days, and those for
the Sundays of Advent (BooklI. lx, lxxx-lxxxv). The presence
of these portioris of the text in a division of the Sacramentary
which is professedly devoted to the Sanctorale may perhaps
