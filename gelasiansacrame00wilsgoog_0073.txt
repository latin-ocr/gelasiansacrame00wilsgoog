lxii INTRODUCTION.

perhaps the first point which strikes our attention is the absence
in the latter os the division into three books, which marks the
earlier manuscript, and which was, in the eyes of its first editor,
a weighty argument in iavour os the identity oi that manuscript
with the Sacramentary 01 S. Gelasius. If we assume that the
early Roman Sacramentary which furnished the basis ot' V. was
divided‚ like V. itsels‚ into three books, of which the first con·
tained the partially developed Proprium de Tempore, the second
the Proprium Sanctorum and Commune Sanctorum ¹, and the
third a series oi unappropriated Sunday missae with the Canon
Actionis and certain missae in quotidianis diebus, we find on
turning to R. and S. that these three divisions bave been com·
bined, augmented, and in part revised. The Proprium de
Tempore bas been developffl by the appropriation oi the missae
Dominicales to particular Sundays, and by the addition of other
Sunday musac assigned to Sundays not provided ior by this
appropriation3 the Proprium Sanctorum has also received addi-
tions, and no longer sormsa separate division, but is broken up,
and its parts interspersed with the Sunday mrk‘sae. The group
os Sunday missac being thus removed from their position
immediately before the Carion Actrbnis, the missac quotidianae
are moved into that place, so that the Canon, with its attendant
series oi Postcommunions and Benedictions super Populum,
stands at the end oi the whole collection. Thus the whole oi
the Sacramentary has received a certain amount of rearrange-
ment, and almost all its parts show a oenain amount ol change
in their position.

But the process oi rearrangement has not been confined to
this general shisting os material. There has been also, it would
seem, in many cases, a rearrangement of the contents of par·
ticular portions Thus, while the greater part os the prayers
which in V. make up the missae lrom Christmas to the
Epiphany are found also in the corresponding portion oi R.
