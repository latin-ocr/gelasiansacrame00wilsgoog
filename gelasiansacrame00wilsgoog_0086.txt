GENERAL' C ONCL'USIONS. lxxv

Gallieno sources, while the· Sacramentary irom which it was
ior the most part copied probably contained insertions and addi·
tions of a date later than the beginning oi S. Gregory’s pontifi·¹
cate Tm Vatican manuscript itseli certainly contains such
Gregorian or post-Gregorian elements

2. If we are not to regard the differences in the structure oi
particular missac, as well as iu the general arrangement oi the
contents of the Sacramentary, which are exhibited by the com·
mon matter oi R. and 8., as compared with the Vatican manu·
script, as being due to the compiler oi V., and to departures, in-
his work oi compilation, irom the order oi the Roman. Sacra-
mentary which he employed, we must consider that a revision.
oi the Sacramentary had taken place between the date ol' the
parent manuscript oi V. and the date oi the parent manuscript,
or manuscripts, oi R. and S. As regards particular portions oi
the contents oi R. and 8., these manuscripts may be separated
irom that which was the original source oi V. by more than one
revision The Icnt missae, in particular, have apparently been
rearranged at some time later than the accession oi Gregory 11.

3. The material contained in the second book oi R was
probably derived irom a source closely akin to that which
furnished parts oi the first and third books os V. Both in the
second book and in certain parts oi the contents oi the first
book R. shows signs oi Gallican influence.

4. The revised ‘Liber Sacramentorum Romanae Ecclesiae'
irom which R. and S. are in the main derived, while ior the
most part preserving in its-missae the iorm which is character·
istic oi the ‘Gelasian' Sacramentaries, was in some respecto
more nearly allied than the parent manuscript of V. to the
recension known as Gregorian, and represented by the first
portion oi the Gregorian Sacramentaries1.

5 The mention oi Roman churches which we find in the
headings oi certain inrisae in R and 8., though not sufficient
evidence to warrant the supposition that the messae in question

were actually taken irorn books in use at Rome, may be held to
show that the revision oi the ‘Gelasian' Sacramentary was not

entirely independent oi Roman influence, and may perhaps
