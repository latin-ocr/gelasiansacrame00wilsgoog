mascarum ars. (a) xlvii

April 11, which is the date indicated as that oi his ‘deposition’
in the Liber Pontrficalir (vol. i. p. 239), and probably the date
intended in the inscription cited by M. Duchesne, in the notes
to his edition oi the same work (Liber Pontr'ficalis, vol. i p. 379,
note 35), where the name oi the month is omitted. The festival
oi All Saints is not noticed, that of S. Caesarius being alone
mentioned on Nou. 1. ΤΙιε mention oi 88. Chrysanthus and
Daria is not on Oct. 25, but on Nov. 29, where they (with
S. Maurus) are joined, as in the Vatican MS.‚ in the same com·
memoration with 8. Saturninus. ln connexion with this juxta-
position it may perhaps be worth while to note the restoration
by Adrian lor the basilica os S. Saturninus ‘unacum cyrne·
terio sanctorum Crisanti et Dariae’ (Lib. Pontis, vol. i. p. 509).
Other saints' days mentioned in 8., but not in M. Battiiol's
list, are SS. Emerentiana and Macarius (Jan. 23); S. Sotheris,
and SS. Zoticus, irenaeus, and Hyacinthus (Feb. 10); SS.
Vitalis, Felicula, and Zeno (with S. Valentinus on Feb. 14);
8. ,luliana (Feb. 16); 88. Perpetua and Felicitas (March 7);
8. Juvenalis (May 3); the Dedr‘catr'a Ecclesiae beatae Martiae ad
Martyres (May 13); S. Vitus (June 15); 8. Benedict (July 11);
the ‘Maccabees' (Aug. 1, where mention is also made of the
veneratior oi S. Peter’s chains); S. Donatus (Aug. ης S. Mag·
nus (Aug. 19); S. Ruius (Aug. 27); S. Priscus (Sept. 1);
S. Gorgonius (Sept. 9); S. Augustinus¹ (Nov. 17); and 8. Da·
masus (Dec. 11). Oi these festivals, those oi 88. Perpetua and
Felicitas andos S. Gorgonius appear in the Philocalian list οἱ
‘Depositiones Martyrum’ ; that oi the Maccabeeswasapparently
oi general observance3 that oi S. Augustinus appears to be the
festival oi a Capuan martyr, who has been confused, at least by
the later scribe, with the Bishop oi Hippo. All the remaining
names oi saints, with the exception oi S· Macarius, may be
connected with places in Italy, while some of thern are certainly
Roman ². It may be noted also that the festival ol S. Nico·
medes (June ι) and that oi S. Michael (Sept 29) are shown by
the titles oi the 8. Gallen MS. to be connected, like that oi
