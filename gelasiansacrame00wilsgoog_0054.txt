Another piece of internal evidence, of a more positive kind,
bearing upon the question of the date of the manuscript, as well
as upon that of the place where it was written, is to be found at
p. 368, where at the bottom of the page there appear in red
uncial letters the words ‘Memento Domine famuli tui Remedii
Episcopi! The purpose of the insertion has evidently been
that Remedius should be mentioned by name in the ‘Memento
vivorum'r and it is at least a most probable conjecture that the
Remedius thus referred to is the great Bishop Remedius of
Chur.. The inference that the Sacramentary belonged to Re·
medius himself 1fs perhaps hardly warrantede but it seems
clear that it must have been written during the life of Reme·
dius, and in some place where bis name would receive such
a special mention.

This mention is given to him, apparently, not as the Bishop
of the diocese, since the Canon Actionis also contains the words
‘et antistite nostro Ill.,' and it seems most likely that its pre·
sence is due to the peculiar position of Remedius as a tempor-al
prince. The see of Chur, in the seventb and eighth centuries,
was hereditary in the family known as the Victoridae. The
Bishops exercised temporal as well as spiritual authority in the
district known as ‘Rhaetia Curiensis' (an entirely un·Teut0nized
district, the boundaries of which nearly corresponded with those
of the diocese), and bore the title of ‘Praenes' The last of
the Victoridae, Bishop Tello, died about 773, and his suc·
censor in the see, Constantius, received probably in that year,
from Charias the Great‚ the title and powers of ‘ Rector⁸.’ The
purpose of Charles in this grant was no doubt to secure bis
power in a district which bad as yet remained‚ by reason of its
isolated situation, practically untouched by Teutonis colonists.
It was not until 806 that he took the further step of with·
drawing this temporal office from the hands of the Bishop and
of organizing the province according to the German fasbion,
under two‘Grafen⁸.’ Thus from 773 to 806 the occupante of
the see of Chur practically retained, under Charles' sanction, the
temporal power which had belonged to their predecessore The
