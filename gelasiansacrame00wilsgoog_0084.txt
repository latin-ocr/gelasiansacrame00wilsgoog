SUNDAY MISSAE OF R. AND S. lxxlll

Collect osv, R., and 8., and has the second Collect instead¹z
in one case the second Collect ol R. and S. differs from that
oi V, and is not found either in V. or in the Gregorian text of
Muratori.

The musac ior the two Sundays between the seventeenth and
the twentieth alter Pentecost in R. and S. are not taken from
the series in V., but correspond in part to those given in the first
part ol the Gregorian Sacramentary sor the Sundays which
precedeand follow the Ember daysoi September,having ol course,
in addition to the forms contained in the Gregoriaa text, asecond
Collect and a Presace in each case. The πίσεα lor the Sunday
aiter the Ember days, however, agrees with the Gregorian musa
only in respect ol the first Collect: the second Collect is found
elsewhere in the first partos the Gregorian text, the Secret aod
Postcommunion are found elsewhere in V, but not in Muratori’s
Gregorian Sacramentary. With ⁴the twentieth Sunday R and
8. return to the missae ol' the third hook ol V. ², and continue to
follow the course ol that series until itis exhausted with the
missa for the twenty-fourth Sunday. For the twentieth Sunday
R and S. discard the second Collect ol the mosa in V, and
substitute lor it that which is the Collect ol the parallel
Gregorian mrhsn For the twenty-first, twenty-third, and
twenty-fourth Sundays they differ from V., and are in agree-
ment with the Gregorian text in regard to the Postcom-
munron.

The last three missae ior the Sundays after Pentecost in R
and 8. are not parallel to any missae contained in V, though
here, as in the metrae ior the fourth, fifth, and sixth Sundays‚
already mentioned, some os the prayers oi which the messae are
composed are'lound in V. in some other position On the other
hand, the last three missas ol the Gregorian supplement are in
general agreement with the corresponding missae ol R. and S.,
save that the latter have, in each case, a second Collect and
