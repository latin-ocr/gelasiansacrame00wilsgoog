PRINTED TEXTS. Ιὶ

archs of Aquileia its date may be after the year rcoo, but is
probably before 1019 ¹. The manuscript is beautifully written
throughout, and contains some fine miniatures and illuminated
letters The portions of its contents which have been used for
this edition are the missae for special purposee, which include
several collects parallel to those in the Vatican manuscript, and
its order for the Burial of the Dead, which in several portions
agrees with the parallel orders in the Vatican and in the
Rheinau Sacramentades.

Vl. For one portion of the order for the Burial of the Dead,
reference hasbeen made to a manuscript Pontifical of English
use, of the twelfth century, which seems to have at one time
belonged to Hereford Cathedral. It is now in the Library of
Magdalen Collegc, Oxford (MS. Magd. 226).

The use made of printed texts has been chiefly for the purpose
of comparison; but some oi these texts have appeared to be
of sufficient value to bc employed also for purposes of correction.
F oremost among these is the text of the Leonine Sacramentary.
The references to this Sacramentary are to the columns of
Muratori's Litargr'a Romana Vetus, but the readings of his
edition have been compared with the more trustworthy text con·
tained in the second volume of the edition of S. Leo's works
prepared by the Ballerini, in which every divergence from the
readings of the manuscript is professedly indicated in the notes.
Next in importance, as regards the use made of them, are the
Gallican Sacramentaries edited by Tommasi and Mabillon, and
the Ordines reproduced by Martene from certain early manu·
scripts To the Gallican books, reference is made by the
columns of Muratori’s Litargia Romana Vetus, but for greater
security his readings have been compared, where that was possi·
ble, with the edition of Neale and Forbes⁸. For the Canon
Actionis recent collatione of the parallel portion of the Musale
Francorum and the Sacramentarr'urrr Gallicanum have been ern-
ploycd as wellas the printed texts. Where the Rheinau and
S. Gallen manuscripts fumish no material for comparison, recourse
has been had to early texts included in the second volume of
Gerbert's Monumenta Vct. Lit. Alemarrnr'cac, and to Ordines
