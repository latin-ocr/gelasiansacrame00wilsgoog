It will be seen from the table that only one of the missae of
V. appears as a whole in R. and S, that, namely‚ sor the
Saturday before the first Sunday os Lenta day lor which the
Gregorian Sacramentary provided no missa. With regard to
the other days, it would seem that, as a general mle, the first
Collect is the same as the Collect ol the Gregorian Sacra-
mentary: but the rule is not by any means absolute.

ln the heading ol each oi the Lent missae os R. and S. (with
the exceptions oi the second Sunday and oi the Saturday before
Palm Sunday) there is mention os the Roman church at which
the ‘station' lor the day was held. The list, as may be seen
from the Appendix (pp. 325-333), differs but slightly from that
which is surnished by the Gregorian sacramentarios oi Pamelius
and Muratori lt seems to differ in regard to the Thursday oi
the first week, where the Gregorian Sacramentaries mention the
church ol S. Laurence ‘ioris murum': but Pamelius' marginal
note seems to indicate that his manuscript, or some other autho·

heading as given in R., and that ‘foris murum' is an erroneous
reading, arising lrom a misunderstanding ol the title ‘ad
Formonsum' or ‘ad Formosum? A more important divergence
is that with regard to the Monday os Holy Week, where R. and
S. mention the church of SS. Nereus and Achilleus, agreeing in
this point with the list in the second volume ol Mabilloo’s
Murcum Italicum, but differing from the Sacramentanes of
Muratori and Pamelius, which, like the present Roman Missal,
place the ‘station' at the church oi S. Praxedes.

An exact comparison osv the missae sor the Ember days, and
os the prayers ‘in xii. Lectionibus’ is rendered difficult by the
fact that in these portions of their contents there is a certain
