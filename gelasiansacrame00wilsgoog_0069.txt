lviii INTRODUCTION.

The treatment which the leaves haveat different times received
prevents the formation of any trustworthy estimate of their
date from their present general appearance, and the character
of the handwriting fumishes the only test by which the date of
the fragment can be determined. The writing is of a rather
unusual type, presenting affinities with both the M'erovingian
and the Lombardic‚ and may point to a date nearly as early as
that of the Vatican manuscript. lt probably does point to
a date earlier than that of either S. or R. The fragmentis
thus perhaps the oldest among the known specimens of the
later type of ‘ Gelasian' Sacramentaries, and its agreement with
S. seems to give additional weight to the evidence of that
manuscript.

None of the manuscripts classed as ‘Gelasian' contains any
mention of S. Gelasius corresponding to the mention of S. Gre-
gory, which we find in the titles of the Gregorian Sacramentariee.
Those which have a title at all are called either ‘ Liber Sacra-
mentorum Romanae Ecclesiae,' or simply ‘Liber Sacramen-
torum.’ Their claim to the name ‘Gelasian’ rests chiefly on
what seems to have been the general usage of the eighth and
ninth centurius, when they were distinguished by this epithet
from the Sacramentaries which claimed to be, and were be·
lieved to be, the work of S. Gregory. But the further question
as tov the foundation of this usage is one which we can hardly
now decide. It may have been the consequence of a tradition
which ascribed to S. Gelasius the origin of the ‘Liber Sacra·
mentorum’ from which they were derived. But we do not find
any clear evidence of such a tradition before the time when the
name appears in use. Gennadius, in the account of S. Gelasius
contained in the treatise De Viris illustribus, speaks of ‘trac-
tatus diversarum scripturarum et sacramentorum' composed by
him. The ‘Liber Pontificalis,’ while it does not say expressly
that S. Gelasius compiled a Sacramentary, does attribute to
him the composition of ‘sacramentorum praefationes et ora-
tiones ’-of forms, that is to say, such as those of which a Sacra-
mentary is an organized collection ¹. Walafrid Strabo, writing
in the first half of the ninth century, goes a step further, and
tells us that S· Gelasius is said to have arranged prayers
'composed by himself and others. He may be understood to
