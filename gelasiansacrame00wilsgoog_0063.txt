lii INTRODUCTION.

printed by Martene in his De Antiquis Ecclesiae Retinet Some

use has alsobeen made of the ‘Ambrosian ’ text contained in the
first volume 01 Pamelius' liturgicon Latinum ², of the Gregorian
text in Muratori’s Liturgtit Romana Vetus, and of Mr. Warren’e
edition 01 the Leofric Missal ⁸.

Three other printed texts have been employed much more
largely, and their readings cite'd much more frequently. But the
purpose of the citatione is rather that of comparison than of
emendation. They serve 33 the means 01 showing the relation
between the text of the Vatican manuscript and the kindred
texts of Rheinau and S. Gallen on the one hand, and the later
recension of the text on the other. These arethe text contained
in Gerbert's Sacramentary, already mentioned, and the Gregorian
Sacramentaries edited by Pamelius⁴ and Menard ⁶. The Sacra·
mentary of Menard is of some special importance, as it contains
a good deal of matter closely parallel to parts of the contenta
of the third book of the Vatican manuscript, which find no place
in the Rheinau Sacramentary.

To attempt anything like a full discussion 01 the questions
relating to the history and development of the Roman Sacramen-
taries is not the purpose of this Introduction, and would be
beyond its scope. But it may be well, for the sake of clearness,
before discussing the variations 01 the Rheinau and S. Gallen
Sacramentaries from the Vatican manuscript, or the points of
resemblance and of difference which they exhibit, as compared
with the Gregorian Sacramentaries, to state certain facts which
form the 'most important data of the general problem.

The Vatican manuscript itself fumishes us with evidence that
before the time of Charles the Great books bearing the title ἱ01
‘Liber Sacramentorum Romanae Ecclesiae’ were known and
used within ‚the Frankish kingdom. It is itself one of these
books: aud the fact that it contains a certain admixture of
Gallican elemeuts, and is clearly not a simple transcript 01
