THIS edition ol the Gelasian Sacramentary was originally
taken in hand in order to provide, lor the use oi persono
studying the Western service-books, a text more convenient
and more easily accessihle than those oi the earlier editions,
and more accurate than that which is included in Migne's
patrologia Latina. For this purpose it was at firstt proposed
to reproduce Tommasi’s text, with an introduction, aud possibly
with notes critical and explanatory. Before adopting this
course, however, it seemed desirahle to examine not only the
Vatican manuscript Reginae 316, from which Tommasi’s text
was taken, but also other manuscript authorities. The result ol
this examination was an enlargement ol' the original design
The Sacramentaries ol Rheinau and S. Gallen proved not only
to be likely to lumish better means oi emendiug the text ol
the Vatican MS. than those which were at the disposal ol
Tommasi or Vezzoai, but to be themselves of such importance
as to warrant an endeavour to make their contents, their
arrangement, and their text more fully known. The task ol
comparing these later ‘Gelasian’ Sacramentaries with the
earlier text of the Vatican MS. has been a slow and laborious
one, since the differentes ol arrangement made it somewhat
hard to trace, in the different recensione, the matter common to
the three MSS.; even now, though the greater part ol the
contentu oi the text has been traced in one or both oi the later
