RESEMBLANCES OF R. Am) Sss TO GREGORIAN BOOK S. lxiii

and S, they there appear in a different order: so also with the
prayers which in V. make up the minae from Easter to Pente-
cost, and so again with the Advent missae and with the prayers
of the massae for the Ember seasona The case is the same, in
several instances, with the prayers for particular festivals in the
Sanctorale, while here we also find that in R. and S. some of
the missae which form the Commune Sanctorum of V. have
been assigned to particular festivals, and the Commune Sanc·
torum has been reconstructed. The missae for the whole of
Lent and Advent have been revised and rearranged, those for
septuagesima, Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima have been
slightly altered. As a general rule, the form of the missa in
R and S. corresponds with that which we find in V.: each
mrhsa, that is to say, contains two Collects before the Secret:
many are also provided with'a Preface ¹, and with a Benedictio
mper Populum. But while R. and S. thus preserve, in the
structure of their missae, the characteristic features of the
‘Gelasian’ Sacramentary, the general result of the revisionis
such 'that the individual missae are brought into closer agree·
ment with the Gregorian missas for the same days than those
of V. Looking merely at the prayers contained in a particular
missa of R or S., as they stand in Gerbert’s text, and com·
paring them with those of the corresponding missa in the
Gregorian Sacramentary of Muratori, we might often be dis·
posed to think that the missa of R. or S. had been constructed
by simply adding to the Gregorian missa such forms as were
needed to make up a missa of the ‘Gelasian’ type: or, ifwe
chose to look at the matter from another point of view, we
might. say that the Gregorian missa seems to have been formed
from the ‘Gelasian' missa of R. or S. by simply disearding the
forms which were not required in a missa of the Gregorian
type lf, however, we take the differences of readings presented
