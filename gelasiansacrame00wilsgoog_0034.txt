GERBERT S TRIPLE SACRAMENTARY. xxiii

sas not always esrem n the employment or un marus or
differentiation. Some entire minas and many portions of

missae which are contained in S. are not distinguished by the
type which ought to mark the matter found in the older books,
while a large number of missae which are absent from R. appear
in his text without the brackets which ought to have indicated
their absence from that manuscript ¹.

But besides this defect of accuracy in following out the plan
he had laid down for himself (a defect which seriously diminishes
the value of the information conveyed by his method) Gerbert’s
way of regarding his materials had another unfortunate result.
'As he was inclined to minimise the differences of text between
R and S, he was also inclined to underrate, or to misunder-
stand, the importance of the changes introduced into the latter
manuscript by the hand of the corrector. These changes were,
in many cases, much more than mere corrections of mistakes
in grammar or variations in spelling. The effect, if not the
purpose, of the corrector's work has generally been the altera·
tion of the original text into closer agreement with the text of
the later Sacramentaries of the type known as ‘Gregorian’
Hence it comes to pass that the ‘Gelasian' portions of the
‘triple text’ of T. (and therefore of Gerbert’s printed text) do
not represent the original text of the ‘Gelasian’ books, but
a revision of that text, apparently based upon the text of the
Sacramentaries of the ‘Gregorian’ type'.' The evidence for
this statement will be found in the notes of the present volume,
where it will again and again appear that the text of R. and the
original text of S. are in agreement with the readings of the
Vatican manuscript, while the readings of the later hand of S..
followed by Gerbert’s printed text, are in agreement with the
