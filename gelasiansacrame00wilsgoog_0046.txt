rna naaman MS. (a.) xxxv

monastery of Rheinau about the middle of the ninth century:
but it is most probable that this event took place earlier, about
the year 800. Before making his monastic profession, S. Fintan,
according to the tradition concerning him, had travelled through
several countries: he is said in particular to have visited both
Tours and Rome. Hence the tradition which connecte the
Sacramentary with him (a tradition with which the apparent
date of the manuscript is quite compatible) does not fumish any
clear indication as to the probable place from which the book
was brought, or in which it was written. The internal evidence
of the book itselt however, makes it pretty clear that it was
written at some place within the Frankish kingdom. '

The Good Friday prayers mention the ‘King’ as well as the
‘Christiani imperatores,' and the ‘imperium Francorum ’ as well
as the ‘imperium Romanorum’ The appearance of prayers for
the Rogation Days points to a district where Gallican usage was
influential ¹. Again, while the missas which make up the
Proprium Sanctorum of the Sacramentary are few in number,
and most ol the saints commemorated (other than the Blessed
‚Virgin, the Apostles, and S. John Baptist) are saints connected
with Rome, there is here to be found what looks like a mark of
Gallican influence, in the presence of a missa for the festival
of S. Leodegarius (Oct. a). Further, the Martyrologr‘um, a
fragment of which remains at the end of the Sacramentary,
contains names which seem to Μ. Delisle to point to some
district of northern Gaul as the place where the manuscript was
written and used ⁸. The peculiar feature presented by the canon
Actionrs, the insertion before the clause communicantes of a
commemoration of the departed, may be due to a local usage:
but the lack of other instances prevents any certain inference on
this point ⁸. A more clear trace of Gallican usage is to be found
in the latter part of the manuscript, in a massa printed by
