table, which includes all the week-days from Ash Wednesday
to the Thursday in Coena Domini, with the exception of the
Sabbatum in xii Lectionibus, which is left out of the rechoning,
for obvious reasons. In this table, V. signifies that the prayer
is included in the messa for the same day in the Vatican manu-
script, Gn, that it is included in the missa for the same day in
Muratori's Gregorian text. Prayers found elsewhere in V. are
marked (tt), those found elsewhere in the first part of the
Gregorian text are marked (Gn), those found only in the sup·
plementary part of the Gregorian text are marked [Gr.], while
an asterisk added to one or other of these symbols indicates
that the prayer appears in the place indicated with some varia-
tion of text. The messae contained in S. are the basis of the
table; R. does not now contain those for the latter part of the
third and the first part of the fourth weeks, while there is
aslight difference of arrangement between R. and S. in regard
to the Monday of the fifth week (see App. p. 331). Each of
the mz'ssae for the first week in S. has a proper Preface3 R.
omits those of the Monday and Tuesday.
