EVIDENCE OF JOHN THE DEACON. lix

say also that the prayers arranged by S. Gelasius were in use
in the churches of Gaul ¹.

By the time when Walafrid wrote, however, the term ‘Gela-
sian’ was alreadyin use, as we see by the inventory of S. Riquier,
and his statement may rest simply on that usage John the
Deecon, writing in the latter half of the ninth century, is more
explicit and detailed in his statement. He tells us8 that
S. Gregory compressed ‘in unius libri volumine' the ‘Gela-
sianum codicem de missarum solemniis,' and that he effected
this object ‘multa subtrahens, pauca convertens, nonnulla vero
superadiciens pro exponendis evangelicis lectionibus! It is upon
thisstatement that Tommasi and others who have followed him
have principally relied in their argument in favour of the Gelasian
origin of the Vatican manuscript. This Sacramentary seemed to
correspond with the indicatione contained in John's statement
asto the character of the ‘Gelasianus codex? It is certainly
the case that it is divided into three books, while the Gregorian
Sacramentary contains, or forms‚a single book But here the
correspondence seems to end. The differentes of arrangement
between the Vatican manuscript and the Gregorian Sacra·
mentary are such that the work of the person who compiled
the latter from the former could hardly be adequately described
by the phrases which John employs, if those phrases are to be
taken strictly. The quantity of matter which, on this theory,
would have been discarded, is certainly considerable: but the
amount of matter which bas changed its place is also very
large: the ‘multa subtrahens' may ht the case well enough:
but the ‘pauca convertens' does not seem to apply. It would
be more applicable, as we shall see, if we suppose that tbe
‘Gelasianus codex' of which John speaks was a Sacramentary
of which the missae were arranged like those in R. or S: aud
R, though not divided into three books, contains more books
than one. But ifwe are to suppose the ‘Gelasianus codex'
which John bad in view to have been a Sacramentary resem-
