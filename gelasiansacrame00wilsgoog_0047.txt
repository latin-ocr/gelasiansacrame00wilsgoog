Gerbert (Mon. Vct. lit. Alam. vol' ι. p. 282), where th'e Sectet
takes the form of a ‘bidding· prayer and begins with the words
‘Auditis nominibus offerentium: which clearly ¹point to a
previous recitation of the names.

The contents of the first portion of the manuscript show, as
hasbeen already said, a cldse resemblance to those of the
S Gallen Sacramentary The missa'e for saints ’days however,-
are far less numerous in the Rheinau than m theS. Gallen, and
the orders for the consecration of the Chrism and for the public
reconciliation of the Penitents on Maundy Thursday are absent
from the Rheinau manuscript The inference to be drawn from*
the non-appearance of these sections seems ' to be that the
manuscript was written for the use of a priest, and not ior that
of a bishop; and this view conceming it will be found to explain'
some points with regard to the second part of its contents. The ’
headings of the missae of the first portion contain mention of
the Roman ‘stations' for the days of Lent, the Ember days, and
for certain festivals, a fact which testities to the Roman origin of
the Sacramentary¹. The presence of missae for the Thursdays
in Lent shows that this part of its text is of a date as late as
the time oi Gregory 11 (715-31).

The second part of the Sacramentary is almost all included
by Gerbert in his sacramentam, but he does not follow the
order in which the parts stand in the manuscript. This will be
seen, it is hoped, more clearly in the Appendix to the present
volume. The second part begins. after the series of Post-
communions and Benedictions which follow the Canon Actrbm's,
and is preceded 'by the words ‘Expliciunt benedictiones anni
circuli est numerus lxxii. Incipit Liber secundus de extrema
'parte’ The ‘benedictiones anni circuli' herereferred to cannot
be the Benedictions which stand immediately before the words:
for these are not by any means so numerous. It seems most
likely that the words were copied by the scribe from a manu·
script in which they stood at the close of a series of Episcopal
Benedictions such as 'were used in Gaul, and might be included
in a Sacramentary intended for use by a bishop, but would
naturally be omitted in a book intended for a priest, by whom

ιΜ. Duchenne (On'ga'nes du Culte no mention of the Roman chnrches:
Chrs'tien, p. 124) seems to include both bnt these hesdingo occur, not always in
che Rheinau and S. Gallen MSS. in his exactly the same form, in. both manu·
