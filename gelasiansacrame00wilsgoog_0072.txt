COMPARISON OF R. AND S. WITH V. lxi

found in the fact that such Sacramentaries were actually dis·
tinguished by this name while they were still in use, and that,
in accordance with this usage, certain forms, such as the
lessons on Easter Even, agreeing with the order prescribed in
these Sacramentaries, were also described as ‘secundum Gela·
sium! The usage may have been the result os an early
tradition as to their origin; but we cannot be certain that this
was so. It may, as M. Duchesne supposes, have sprung up in
the eighth or ninth century, when it was desired to distinguish
the older form oi Sacramentary from that which bore the name
os S. Gregory, and have owed its origin to the tradition pre·
served in the ‘Liber Pontificalis,' that S. Gelasius was the
author os ‘preiaces and prayers¹.’ In any case, it would bave
been admitted by those who used the term that the whole
‘Gelasian' Sacramentary, as they knew aud used it, had not pro·
ceeded from S. Gelasius: audit is hard to think that, ii there had
been a general heliel, in the early part oi the eighth century,
that the main body ol the ‘Gelasiao' Sacramentary, apart from·
certain things obviously of much more recent origin, was really
due to S. Gelasius, the compiler oi the supplement to the
Gregorian Sacramentary would have reirained from citing the·
authority os S. Gelasius ior the forms which he transferred from
the older Sacramentaries to his own compilation, and would
have been content, as he was content, to state in his intro·
ductory presace that his material was drawn from the work oi
authorities other than S. Gregory.

For the use of the term in our own day, and especiallyfor
its nse as applied to the Vatican manuscript, we may plead not
only the usage oi the time when these Sacramentaries were still
employed, but the current use oi liturgical scholars. The name
is a convenient one, so long as we do not use it as a ‘question-
begging epithet': it has, ever since Tommasi's time, been-
geoerally applied to the one Sacramentary ol this class which
has been really known to students os the Western Liturgies,
and it would be unreasonable, unless some clear advantage
could be expected from a change, to attempt to alter the title
by which the book hassolong been known ,

ln comparing the arrangement oi the Vatican manuscript with
that oi the later ‘ Gelasian' codices, as represented by R and S,
