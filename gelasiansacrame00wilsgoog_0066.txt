CONTINUANCE OF ‘GELASIAN' BOOKS. lv

Gregorianus et Gelasianus . . . ab Albino ordinatus' is most
probably a copy ol the Gregorian Sacramentary including the
supplement: il so, we have here a confirmation ol the view which
ascribes that supplement to Alcuin. The ‘Missalea Gelasiani'
lar more numerous, are Sacramentanes ol the older type, ol
which it is expressly said that they are among the ‘libri sacrarii'
and employed in the service ol the altar.

Le Brun, in commenting on this passage, notes it as an
argument in favour 'ol' the view that the Benedictines retained
the older or ‘Gelasian' Sacramentary alter the introduction ol
the Gregorian ¹. But its retention was not contined to the
monastic communities. In a record ol a diocesan visitation by
Hiucmar ol Rheims, held probably about the year 850, we find,
in the inventories oi books belonging to parisb churches, the
mention of ‘Gelasian' as ‘well as ol ‘Gregorian’ missals: iu
one case the only missal ol the church seems to have been
‘Gelasian².’

’ How long the use ol the ‘Gelasian’ Sacramentary continued,
side by side with that ol the Gregorian‚ can hardly be determined.
But tbe evidence ol the triple Sacramentary used by Gerbert
would seem to show that in the tenth century the ‘Gelasian'
rite was still not a mere survival, but was so lar in practical use
as to rank, sor the purposes ol the compilet ol that collection,
which can hardly be supposed to have been merely antiquarian,
with the Gregorian and Ambrosian rites. Traces ol irs partial
use may also be found. Thus in a Poitiers Pontifical, cited by
Matiene, who supposed it to have been written about tbe year
900, we find provision lor the possibility ol the lessons on Easter
Even being either ‘secundum Gelasium' or ‘secundum Gre-
gorium⁸,' while in another manuscript mentioned by Vezzosi,
