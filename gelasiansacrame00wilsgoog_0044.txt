Gerbert l'ails to give 'any accurate information as to its ‘textor
arrangementff ³ ·

The volume now contains 189 leaves oi parchment, the' siae· ol'
the leaves being about 11 ¹by 6766666· The leaves have been
numbered by peges, beginning with the verso of the first leaf.
The numeration has been made *rather carelessly; only one
side oi each leai hasbeen numbered; the numbering is not
consecutive in some cases where nothing ie wanting in the
manuscript13 one leal bears the same number as that which
precedes it¹; and there are three unnumbered leaves⁸. The
bindingis not ancient ·

Αιι examination oi the gatherings shows that, besides being
defective at the end, the volume has, at some time anterior to
the numbering oi the pages, lost several leaves. - It now con-⁴
taine twenty-three gatherings, each oi which appears to have
consisted-oi eight leaves. Only one os these is now signed‚ the
old numbering having probably been cut off in the case oi the
others. The collation may be given summarily as follows, the
gatherings being indicated by letters· -

The only one with a signature is the gathering V, which
is marked-xvi. This is the sixteenth gathering oi the Sacra·
mentary proper, which begins with the fisth gathering oi the
volume, at the page marked 54. Hence it may be inferred that
the first l'our gatherings oi the present book did not originally
form part oi the same 'volume with the Sacramentary. They

areapparently oi about the same date with the Sacramentary
itsell with the exception os the last two leaves, which are iu
a rather later hand. The contents oi these preliminary leaves
are as follows:-

(ι) Portionss os a Gradual⁴, beginning onp 1, and occupying
thirteen leaves.

(a) Portions oi a Penitential, beginning on p 28, and occupy·
,ing eleven leaves. ·
