amount of differente between R. and S. Both agree in fumish·
ing two series of missae for the ‘Ieiunium quarti mensis,² of
which one (which in S. agrees throughout with the series of the
Gregorian Sacramentary of Muratori, save for the addition of
a Preface to the Wednesday mrhsa) stands between the meisa
for Pentecost and that for the octave. Thev prayers of the other
series, which is placed after the missa for the third week after
Pentecost, are very closely in agreement with those of the series
for the Pentecost week in V. The presence of the two series is
probably due to the usage, which existed in some places, of
observing the last in the ‘fourth month,’ without regard to the
date of? Pentecost. The prayers for the other three seasons,
while not agreeing exactly either with thoseof V. or with those
of the Gregorian Sacramentary, have, taken together as a whole,
perhaps more points of agreement with the latter, while they
contain in each case some elements which are found in V. and
are absent from the Gregorian missas.

A minute comparison with regard to the mr‘ssas for the prin·
cipal festivals and for the Saints’ days which are common to the
Proprium Samiorum of V., of R. and S, and of the Gregorian Sa·
eramentary‚ cannot well be carried out within the limits of an In-
troduction. The means for such a comparison will, it is hoped,
be considerably increased by the present volume: and it may
suffice for the present purpose to say that these missae point, on
the whole, to the same conclusion as those which have already
been discussed. R. and S. show, as a general rufe, more points
of agreement with the Gregorian text than can be found¹ in the
missuros V. At the same time, they often retain prayers which
are found in V., but are absent from Muratori's Gregorian text,
and thus show their connexion both with the early form of the
Roman Sacramentary which furnished the basis of V., and with
the -later form exhibited by the Gregorian books. A further
point of some importance is brought to our notice byan examin-
ation of another portion of their contenta.

The Sunday missae of V. fall into three divisions. One series
is included in each book. That in the first book consists of the
missaefor the Sundays from Septuagesima to Easter, of which
we have already spoken, of the missae· for Easter and its octave,
for Pentecost and its octave, and for the Sundays ‘post clausum
Paschae' and ‘post‘ Ascensam Domini' The Sundays ‘post
clausurn Paschae' are six in number, and this division, therefore,
