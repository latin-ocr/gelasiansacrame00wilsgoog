missa, where the peculias significance oi the Gregorian Collect
depende upon the Roman usage, which made the ‘station ’² tha-t
day at the church ol S. Paul, and where the remaining prayers
oi the missa are not found in the Gregorian text ¹.

The missae os the Sundays ol Lent in R. and S. present
sewer points oi comparison with V.‚ since in that manuscript th'e
missae sor the ‘Scrutinies’ are assigned to the third, fourth,
and fiith Sundays: these missae are to be iound' also in R, but
not assigned to the same, osindeed to any particular daysl.
In the musa which R and S. assign to³the first Sunday‘oi
Lent, the first Collect is the same, with a slight variation, as in
Muratori’s Gregorian text, the second the same as · the first
Collect ol V., the secret is common to V. and to the Gregorian,
the Postcommunion isin the Gregorian missa‘but not in'V.,
while the Super Populum is the same as in V., not· appearing‘in
Muratori's Gregorian text, but being iound in the Codex Otto-
ornianus. For the second Sunday, the first Collect is Gregorian,
whilerthe remaining prayers agree with V.; the Postcommunion
appears elsewhere in the Gregorius books, and the Super
Populum is in the missa sor the same day in the Codex Otto·
boniarus. For Palm Sunday, the whole os the prayers os R.
and S, with the exception ol the Postcommunion, agree with
the missa in V. The first Collect is common to the Gregorian,
and the Super Populum, once more, is in the missa oi the
Codex Ottobomhuus. The· Postcommunion, which is not Gre-
gorian, occurs elsewhere in V. Turning to those Sundays sor
which V. employs the musar sor the ‘serotinus‘ we find that
in R. and S., on the third Sunday, the first Collect agrees with
the Gregorian missa, and the Super Populum with-that ol the
