lx INTRODUCTION.

bling R. or S, it becomes more probable that his statement
was based simply on a comparison of what in his own day was
known as the ‘Gelasian’ Sacramentary with what was known
as the Gregorian, and therefore less likely that his statement
expresses an early tradition, uncoloured by the opinion of the
writer or his contemporaries The question seems, however, to
be rendered more difficult, whatever view we take as to the
character of the ‘Gelasian codex,’ by his mention of another
point with regard to S. Gregory's work. Il the words ‘nonnulla
vero superadiciens’ stood by themselves, they might apply to
either of the supposed cases, at least as exactly as the phrases
‘multa subtrahens’ and ‘pauca convertens! But it is difficult
to see how the phrase ‘nonnulla vero superadiciens pro expo·
nendis evangelicis lectionibus’ is to be explained as a reference
to anything contained in the Gregorian Sacramentary· as we
have it now, or as we know it to have been received before
the time at which John the Deacon wrote. Possibly an
explanation might be found bya comparison of the degrees in
which the Gelasian and Gregorian books serve by their arrange·
ment to- illustrate the Liturgical Gospels. But it seems also
possible that we have here an indication that John’s statement
does not rest simply on the impression which he had formed of
the comparative contents of the ‘Gelasian’ and ‘Gregorian’
codices of his own day, but in part depends upon some source
of information now unknown to us, as to the actual work of
S. Gregory1.

The only authority, therefore, which can be alleged with
certainty for the use of the term ‘Gelasian’ as applied to the
class of Sacramentaries which includes V., R, and S, is to be
