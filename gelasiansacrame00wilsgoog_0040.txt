rrra VATICAN'MS. (ν.) xxix

S. Gallen books: these also contains similar set os missae sor
ordinary days, with the Canon Actionis and appended series· of
Postcommunionsand Benedictions. But with the last oi these
the S. Gallen book now ends, so that that Sacramentary has
nothing corresponding to the latter part oi the third book. The
Rheinau Sacramentary, on the other hand, contains a similar
series oi special messae and occasional prayers, having much in
common with the parallel portion oi the Vatican manuscript.

In the third bools, once more, we find some indications that
the Roman Sacramentaryused by the compuer was probably
later than the beginning ol the seventh century. In the Canon
Actionis the clause Diesque nostros, said to have been added by
S. Gregory, is present, and the name ol S. Gregory is mentioned
among 'those oi the saints ¹. But we may notice on the other
lnand, that many ol the special mersae in the latter portion oi
the book, which have clauses ior insertion in the Canon, take no
notice oi the clause Diesque nostros, but pass directly from the
end os the Hanc igitur to the Quam oblatrbnem. This may
indicate ior these sections an origin earlier than the time oi
S. Gregory's pontificate: but the inlerence -is not a certain
one

The spelling and grammar os the manuscript are, as might be
expected in a manuscriptos the Merovingian period, exceed·
ingly capricious and irregular. The method which hasbeen
adopted in reproducing its text is one which is certainly open
to some objections, but it appeared, aiter careiul consideration, to
beon the whole the most satisfactory ior practical uses.

From one point os view it would no doubt have been desirable
to aim at an exact literalreproduction nithe text of the manu·
script, with all its errors But the conditions under which the
preparation os this edition has been carried on ¹rendered this
course practieally impossible, since it would have required, not
only the making oi an- exact transcript, but also, if the work
were to be done-with the minute care which such a method
would demand, the careiul correction of the prees-sheeu by
comparison with the manuscript itseli. It would bave required
