xlii INTRODUCTION.

of the ninth century. Sometimes the original writiog has been
altogether erased, and in some other cases it is not quite clear
what the reading of the first hand has been: butio the great
majority of instances the original reading can be quite clearly
made out. In citing the readings of the MS. in the notes to the
present volume, the original text is indicated by the symbol 8¹
(a query being added where the reading seems probable, but not
absolutely certain) and the emended text by the symbol 5¹.
Speaking generally, it may be said that in the matter common
to this MS, the Vatican MS, and Gerbert’s text, the readings of
5ι arc in agreement with the Vatican MS. and those of S· with
Gerbert's text. But the portions of the MS. where the cor·
rector has used the greatest freedom arethe Prefaces, the
greater number of which are not contained in the Vatican MS.
In these portions also, the readings of S² generally agree with
those of Gerbert’s text. ·

A further point to be noted with regard to the MS. is the
appearance in many places of notes, most of which may be
assigned to the tenth century, which have apparently been
intended, as M. Delisle remarks, for the guidance of a scribe
who was engaged ·in writiog a Sacramentary, using the MS.
as his model, but making some variatione from its order, and
incorporating matter from other sources. lt may be observed
that in its divergences from the text of the S. Gallen MS, as
corrected, the ‘Gelasian' text ol Gerbert's triple Sacramentary
almost always follows these marginal directions: and this fact
strongly supports Gerbert’s view that the S. Gallen MS. was
that employed by the scribe of his triple Sacramentary (‘ San-
gallensis olim, nunc Turicensis') for the ‘Gelasian' part of his
compilation.

It seems most likely that the manuscript, though it had very
possibly passed into the possession of the monastery of S. Gallen
before the time when Gerbert‘s triple Sacramentary was written,
was not written in that house. lt is most improbable that it
would in that case have contained no missa lor the Festival of
S. Gall: and there is no such missa in the Sacramentary itself,

though the deficiency is, as we have seen, supplied by some of
the leaves added at a later time. Among the notes already
mentioned isone at the point (p. 307) where the Festival would
fall, ‘ Hic scribe de Sco. Gallo‘: and in Gerbert’s text we lind
the services for the Vigil and F estival inserted.
