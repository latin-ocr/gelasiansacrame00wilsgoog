described by Μ. Leopold Delisle ¹, and from his descriptione the
following brief account os its extemal features is drawn The
manuscript contains 245 leaves, measuring 263 by 164 milli·
metres (or about rol by 6} inches)‚ and is written throughout
·iu uucial characters with the exception ol the Latin versione ol
the bilingual texts of the Lord's Prayer¹ and the Creed ⁸.

The Greek versions are written in Roman⁴ uncials, while the
Latin versione, between the lines nithe Greek, are ina minuscule
hand ot' a Lombardic type. The contents of the manuscript are
divided into numbered sections, the headings ol which are
written in red and green The last page os each guthering ol

these signatures, as in the numeration os the sections ol' the
text, the number six is occasionally denoted by the Epwemon.

ispreceded by an ornamental design covering the verso ol
a leaf the recto ol which is leit blank The design in each case
is that oi an arch enclosing a cross having the letters Alpha and
Omega dependent t'rom its arms⁴. The titles prefixed to the
three books are as follows :-

(i)·1n nomine Domini Ihesu Salvatoris. Incipit liber Sa·-
cramentorum. Romanae aecclesiae ordinis anui circuli’

(ii) ‘Incipit liber secundus. Orationes et praeces de nataliciis
sanctorum?

(iii) ‘Incipit liber tercius. Oracioues et praeces cum canone
per dominicis diebus‘

mentorum. Deo gracias?

script to the seventh, or the eerly part of the eighth, century.
The lact that it was written t‘or some church iu the Fraukish
kingdom is shown not only by the names ol saints mentioned in
the Canon, but also by the mention ol the ‘Imperium Fran·
corum’ in the Good Friday prayers The Sacramentary itsell
