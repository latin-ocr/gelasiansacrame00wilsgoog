(4) ‘Benedictio super Ramos-Palmarum.'

The portions (3) and (4) occupy the leaves marked 50 and 52.

The Sacramentary itself is written in a hand which cannot be
very precisely dated, but may confidently be assigned to the
eighth century. lt shows some of the characteristics of the
Lombard type of writing, but these are not very strongly
marked. The spelling and grammar of the manuscript are very
frequently faulty; the most notable errors of spelling are the
use of ac not only for e and a, but also occasionally for i, and
the interchange of u and 0. The ablative and accusative cases
are frequently interchanged; the present participle appears at
times to take the place of an imperative, while the imperative is
occasionally used with ut, asin the Vatican MS. In 3 few
cases errors of grammar 3ηά spelling have been corrected by
alater hand.

The Sacramentary has, 33 Gerbert remarks, no title: but the
absence ofa title is probably due to the loss of a leaf, as the
first leaf of the gathering with which the Sacramentary begins ls
wanting. In the S. Gallen MS. the title occupies the verso of
the first leaf of the Sacramentary, facing the first page of the
text, and it is quite likely that the same arrangement was
formerly to be found'in the Rheinau manuscript, the contents of
which so far correspond with those of the S. Gallen book as to
favour the conjecture that both codices bore the same title.
The differences between the two Sacramentaries in respect of
contentu and arrangement will, it is hoped, be clearly'seen from
the Appendix to the present volume. In the matter common
to the two, if allowance be made for the more irregular ortho-
graphy of the Rheinau Ms, the correspondence of readings is
well marked : and there can be little doubt that both are derived
from a text of the ‘ Liber Sacramentorum ' which, though perhaps
differing in arrangement from that which was employed by the
compilet of the Vatican manuscript, was yet closely related to
that earlier text.

The Rheinau Sacramentary, according to a tradition recorded
in the written catalogue of the Rheinau MSS, now at zurich,
was believed hythe community of Rheinau to have been brought
to the monastery by S. Fintan, who, though not the founder,
was afterwards regarded as the patron saint of the community.
The note in the catalogue states that S. Fintan entered the
