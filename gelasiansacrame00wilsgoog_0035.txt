‘Gregorian' Samamentaries edited by Pamelius and by Menard,
or with the Sacramentary known as the ‘Leofric Missal.’

Thus, while Gerbert's¹ text contains a larger proportion of
prayers derived from ‘Gelasian’ sources thau the text of Pame·
lius, or even of Menard, its value as a meaos of elucidating the
text of the Vatican manuscript is practieally not much greater
than that of the ‘Gregorian’ books, except where it is directly
taken from the older Sacramentary which Gerbert, for a large
part of his work, deliberately set aside, or where the tenth
century manuscript which he preferred to follow has retained
unaltered the original reading of one or both of the older books
The actual text, as well as the actual arrangement of those older
manuscripts is, as M. Duchesne remarks ¹, ‘very imperfectly
known'to us from his work, in spite of the labour and pains
which that work must have cost him.

On the other hand, however, the evidence of these two manu·
scripts, to which Gerbert was the first to direct attention,
appears upon examination to be of considerable importance in
·its bearing upon the text of the Vatican manuscript. The
later manuscripts furnish us, in some cases, with the meaos of
correcting that text: they sometimes show us, by their agree-
ment with the Vatican manuscript in readings apparently faulty,
that the errors of that manuscript, to whatever cause they are to
beassigned, are not always due to the aberrations of a single
scribe. Further, it may perhaps be found thata comparison of the
contents and arrangement of the three ‘Gelasian’ sacramentaries
may throw some light on the history of the class of Sacra·
mentaries to which they belong, and on the origin of the par·
ticular Sacramentary to which the name ‘Gelasian' has now.
been for a long time attached.

Before proceeding to touch upon these questions it will be
best .to give some account of the manuscripts themselves, of
other manuscripts used in the revision of the text, and of the
use which has been made of the manuscript and printed material
employed.
