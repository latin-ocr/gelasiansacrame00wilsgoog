such'iorms as would, at a later time, have been included in a
‘Pontifical‚’ and these forms stood at the beginning oi the ‘Liber
secundus'¹‚ the portion which remained, alter their omission,
would naturally enough be described as‘ de extrema parte! In
this case, the first portion ol the ‘Liber secundus' probably
included the forms ol ordination, the ‘Consecratio Virginum,'
the forms sor Dedication ol Churches, and perhaps also the order
sor the Reconciliation oi the Penitents‚ and such forms for the
Reconciliation ol Heretics as we find in sections lxxxv-lxxxvii
ol the first book oi the Vatican manuscript.

these It begins with a selection ol Collects ior.Mattins,Vespers,
aud other Hours. Next comes the Ordo Baptisteris‘‚ including
not only the actual Baptismal ritcs, with the lorm for hallowing
the sont, but also the missae lor the ‘ Scrutinies: the exorcisms
to be said over the catechumene, and the forms relating to the
Baptism oi the Sick‚ and to the admission ol a heathen to the
status oi a catechumen. These correspond very closely with the
various sections of the Vatican manuscript which provide lor the

firmation which in the Vatican manuscript stands at the end oi
the Baptismal order: the reason lor this omission is probably
the same which has dictated the omission ol the mr'ssa chrismato.
