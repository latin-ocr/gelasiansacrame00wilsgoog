The desire ol' Charles the Great was to make the adoption of
the Gregorian Sacramentary universal and exclusive throughout
his dominions, and it was no doubt partly with the view of
assisting such a general adoption that the second part, or supple-
ment, was added to the text lurnished by Adrian, which, as we
may infer, did not contain all that was required. If, as seems
most likely, we may judge from the contenta oi the supplement
what Adrian’s copy of the Sacramentary left to be provided
from other sources, it would appear that what was sent to
Charles as the Roman Sacramentary os S. Gregory contained
no missae for ordinary Sundays‚ such as those aster Epiphany
and aster Pentecost, and no missae sor special purposes such as
those which are contained iu the third book of the Vatican
manuscript Μ. Duchesne argues that Adrian's book wasa
copy of the Sacramentary prepared sor the use of the Pope, and
included only the prayers lor festivals and ‘stational’ days, which
would be said by the Pope himself ². 'With the addition ol the
supplement, however, the Gregorian Sacramentary was suitable
sor general use, and was accordingly generally adopted, accord·
ing to Charles' direction.

It was not, however, at once adopted so completely as to

exclude the use of the older Roman Sacramentaries, which we
find, in the ninth century, distinguished by the name of ‘ Gelasian’
Thus in the Chronicle of the Abbey ol S. Riquier‚ we find in an
inventory drawn up in 831, the following entry :-

‘De libris sacrarii qui ministerio altaris deserviunt Missales

temporibus ab Albino ordinatus i: Lectionarii Epistolarum et
Evangeliorum mixtim et ordinate compositi v:· Missales Gela·
siani xix ⁸!

Here the ‘Missales Gregoriani' are no doubt some oi the
copies oi Adrian's book which were multiplied and distributed,
under Charles' direction, soon after its reception: the ‘Missalis
