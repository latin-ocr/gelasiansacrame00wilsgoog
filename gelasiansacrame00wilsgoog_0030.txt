GERBERrs YRIPLE SACRAMENYARY. xix

but also in arrangement and in contente. Its division into
three books, and some other indicatione, seerned to show that
it was really a specimen of that older Roman Sacramentary
which writers ol the ninth century alleged to have been recast
by S. Gregory, and which they connected with the name os
S. Gelasius But there were no other ‘Gelasian’ Sacramen-
taries known to its editors: and although here and there the
Gregorian books which they were able to employ might throw
light on the textos the Vatican manuscript, where this was
faulty or obscure, they were 01 less valne sor such a purpose
than books more nearly approaching to the date os the Vatican
manuscript, 3ηά more nearly allied to it in structure.

Belore Muratori issued his reprint, or Vezzosi issued his new
edition, Pierre Le Brun, the learned French Oratorian, had
published, under the title of Explr'catr'on de la Messe ¹, his
valuable dissertations on the Liturgy. He also recognizes, in
the manuscript published by Tommasi,a representative 01 the
Sacramentary ol S. Gelasius; buthe regards it as only one
specimen os a class oi manuscripts oi which he knew other
examples Some of these, he tells us, he pmposed to publish
in his projected Bibliotheca Liturgica ; and while hc specifies
several points ol distinction betw'een the ‘Gelasian’ 3ηά the
‘Gregorian' Sacmmentaries, his language suggests that his
statements as to the former class were based upon a consider·
abl'e number os instances¹. Unhappily the Bibliotheca liturgica
never appeared, and Le Brun's mention of ‘ Gelasian' books had
not dre effect os producing an enquiry as to their place or their
contents

In 1777 Dom Martin Gerbert, Abbot of S. Blaise in the
Black Forest, published, in the first volume os his Monumenta
Veteris Limrgiu Alemannicael, a text which was in part pro·
ieesedly‘Gelasian,’ 3ηά conceming which there could be little,
if any, doubt that it was in part actually drawn from a Sacra-
mentary nithe class which was 111 the ninth century known as
‘Gelasian' At first sight, therefore, it would seem that Ger·
bert's text must have 3 high value sor the purpose of comparison
with the text of the Vatican manuscript. His work has certainly
