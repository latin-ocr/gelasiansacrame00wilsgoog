documents reproduced by Martene, since these later texts,
though later, still serve to show that the grammatically co'rrect
form was current before the literary reforms of Charles the
Great‚ or in manuscripts which contain a sufficient amount of
error to make it clear that their texts owed little or nothing
of their correctness to these reforma Where no such evidence
for the early existence of a grammatical reading of a passage
is to be found, or where the kindred manuscripts of Rheinau
and S. Gallen clearly support the ungrammatical reading, that
reading has been retained in the text, and its character, in
most cases, indicated by the appended notes.

The most uotable grammatical errors of the manuscript are
the followingt- ,

(a) The abuse of cases The ablative and accusative cases
are frequently interchanged: in some instances the apparent
misuse of the ablative may be due to the accidental omission of
asuperscribed m: but this theory would not account for the
whole of the instances. In oue or two places the accusative
seems to be used for the nominative¹: but these cases may be
due to the loss of some word in the text· -

(b) The use of the imperative mood for the subjunctive,
following ut. This may perhaps, at least in the majority of
instances, be explained by supposiug that ut isa clerical error
foret: but the fact that the verb, rather than the conjunctiora,
hasbeen altered in the later recension of the text, musthe
taken into account in estimating the character of the error.

(c) The present participle is occasionally used (probably with
a suppression of the verb substantive) in an imperative sense ¹.

Τὴε interchange of certain letters, which is a marked feature
of the spelling of tlue manuscript, is no doubt due in many cases
to similarity of sounds The following are the chief cases of
substitution or variation ⁸ :-

ais used for ae, e, in some instantes for i (eg. arabus:
thuribulis).

ae(or its equivalent ς) is used for a, e, oe, i.
