IMPORTANCE OF R. AND S. xlix

'of the· present volume, and by the scheme of the contente of
the S. Gallen manuscript, which will be found in the Appendix

From what has already been said of the Rheinau and
S. Gallen Sacramentaries, it will appear that there are strong
grounds for regarding them as independent witnesses The
Rheinau manuscript shows traces of Gallican influence which are
absent from the S. Gallen manuscript: there is reason to think
that the two manuscripts were written indifferent localities:
they are not, indeed, very widely separated in date; but the
limited character which marks the Proprium Sanctorum of the
Rheinau manuscript may be taken as an indication that it was
copied from a text a good deal earlier than that employed by
the scribe of the S. Gallen manuscript. The amount of irregu-
larity of spelling and of grammr exhibited by the two, while it
is sufficient in each case to show that the text has not been much
affected ‘by the movement for reform in these matters, is so
much greater in the one than in the other as to supply a further
reason for regarding them as mutually independent: while this
view is also supported by the absence from one of prayers and
Prefaces contained in the parallel sections of the other. When
we compare them with the Vatican Sacramentary, hitherto
k'nown as the ‘Gelasian,' we find that, taken together, they
include byfar the greater part of its contente. They differ from
itin the arrangement of the common matter: and the differences
of arrangementare by no means few or unimportant But of
these differences, and of the inferences to be drawn from them,
it will be more convenient to treat at alater stage It is sufficient
here to note two facts: first, that the proportion of matter
common to these three Sacramentaries of the ‘ Gelasian’ type is
very large; and second, that in cases where such common
matter is also found in the Sacramentaries of the later or
‘Gregorian' type, the three ‘ Gelasian’ Sacramentaries¹ are very
often in agreement with one another, as against what appears to
be the later recension of the text, presented by the ‘ Gregorian'
Sacramentaries.

For these reasons it would seem to be clear that in the task
of verifying or correcting the readihgs of the Vatican manu-
script, the two Sacramentaries of Rheinau and S. Gallen must,
asa general rule, be our principal authorities3 though in some

¹ 'l'bis statement, so faras the S. Gallen the original readings, not to the later
manunipt is concnned, has reference to corrections or alterations.
