indicate that a Roman Sacramentary, of 'a date later than the
accession of Gregory II, furnished part of the materials em·
ployed in the revision ¹.

6. The use of the ‘Gelasian’ Sacramentary of the later type
was not confined to the churches of Gaul, but seems to have
existed also in the district of Rhaetia curiensis ,The S. Gallen
Sacramentary, which furnishes evidence of such use, contains
few, if any, distinct signs of Gallican influence

7. The ‘Gelasian’ books of the type of R. and S. furnished to
the compilet of the supplementary part of the Gregorian Sacra·
mentary the most important portione of his text In adopting
the missae, prefaoes and prayers which he took frorn thern,
he appears either to have made some corrections and altera-
tions ol the text, which were followed hythe second hand of
the S. Gallen manuscript, or to have employed a text which
had been corrected and emended in the same way as the
S. Gallen Sacramentary.

The later ‘Gelasian' books, therefore, may be said to form
a link between the recension ol the Sacramentary represented
by V, and the Gregorian Sacramentaries of that recension
which we now possess3 so far as regards the supplement, their

relation to the Gregorian books seems to be clear. But before
we can fully determine their importance in the history of the

Sacramentary, another question remains to be solved, the ques-
tion, that is to say, of their precise relation to the ‘Liber
sacramentorum' sent by Adrian to Charles the Great. The
question is one which seems to have an important bearing on
the history of the Westem Liturgy: but it probably requires,
forits full solution, not only some further study of material
already edited, but also some further examination and com-
parison of manuscripts. For such work, in both its branches, it

is boped that the present volume may prove to be a useful
instrument

¹ The mention of the Roman ‘ statlom' have been luserted, bad this not bem the
for the Tbursdays in lent would hardly osse.
