FERIAL MISSAE OF LENT IN R. AND S. lxvii

Codex ottobonianus: the second Collect, Secret, and ‚Postcom·
rnunion appear in· other Gregorian missae, while the last is also
found in V.. but is assigned to another day. For the fourth
Sunday, all but the Super Populum agree with Muratori’s
Gregorian text, the ’ Secret appearing elsewhere in V., while the
Super Populum is the same as the Postcommunion of the me'ssa
ior the ‘Scrutiny’ For the fifth Sunday, all the prayers are
contamed in the ‘Gregorian Sacramentary, but only the first
Collect is common ‘to the Gregorian missa sor the Sunday:
no part oi the mz’sso is lound in V. Possibly the small pro·
portion os agreement which the missae ior these three Sundays
show with the contents oi V. may be due to the suppression in
V. os the missae with which they might have been expected to
agree: sor whatever reason, the amount os their contenta which
canbe traced in V. is much less than in the case ol the missae
ior the other Sundays os Lent1. Each of the Sunday mersae
of R. and S. contains a proper Preface3 these appear, with more
or less variation, in the supplementary part of the Gregorian
Sacramentary.

The mursae ior the weekdays of Lent in R. and S. differ
from the series in V, in the first place by the addition oi a mr‘ssa
ior the Thursday in each week. It was perhaps the intro·
duction oi the Thursday ‘station' which gave occasion sor
a rearrangernent of the whole oi this portion os the Sacra-
mentary. The Thursday missae oi R. and S. are, sor the most
part, made up os prayers which occur elsewhere in V. The
same, indeed, may be said oi most of the week-day missae:
but, in many oi them, some prayers are included which do not
appear in V., and which do occur, though not always in the
same position, in the Gregorian Sacramentary: while others,
common to'V. and to the Gregorian books, are placed in R.
andS. in the same position which they occupy in the Gregorian
text. In some instances, however, even where this is the case,
the readings os R. and S. agree with V. where the Gregorian
text shows a difference from the latter manuscript. The
stmcture, and the apparent source oi the missae oi R. and S.
'may' perhaps be most conveniently shown by the following
