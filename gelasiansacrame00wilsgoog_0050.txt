in the manuscript used by the compilet, a consecutive whole,
The forms relating te the Consecration- of Churches are followed
by the sections relating to the Minor Orders: these are followed
by missae for the anniversaries of the ordination of the cele·
brant as Deacon and as Priest Next come the prayers for the
Consecration of Bishops, which are followed by anniversary
missam and these are succeeded by the emmam sacrae
virgine, which again is followed bya series of musae for the
anniversary of the profession It seems that there can be little
doubt that the Ordination forms which now stand at the
beginning of the book have been. transferred to a new place
by the compilet, who has failed to transfer along with them
the anniversary missae which were annexed to them in their
original position. Thus we may see that the forms of Ordi-
nation, and the form for the benediction of nuns were probably,
in tlre manuscript which he used, all placed togethcr¹. Such
a collection would include the greater part of the matter which,
as hasbeen suggested above, the scribe of the Rheinau MS.
discarded from the ‘Liber secundus: as not required for the
purpose which his book was intended to serve.

Returning to the actual contents of the Rheinau MS. we
find that it contains, after the Ordo Raptim, a collection
of mosae, benedictinos, and prayers for special purposes, corre-
sponding in general character, and sometimes closely agreeing
in arrangement and in text, with the similar collection in the
third book of the Vatican MS. We find also the form for
the reconciliation of a penitent at the point of death, the Com·
murdarch Animae, and the order for the Burial of the Dead
(in somewhat more minute detail than the parallel portion of
the Vatican MS.); and these are followed, as in the Vatioen
MS, by a collection of Missae pro defunctis. There are also

some forms for the exorcismos ‘possessed' persons, which in
part agree with the parallel portion of the Vatican MS. With
these the Sacramentary ends ;¹ for the Breviorium Apostolorum
