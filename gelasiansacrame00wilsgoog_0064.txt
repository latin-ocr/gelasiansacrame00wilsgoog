THE GREGORIAN SACRAMENTARIES. liii

the introduction oi the Roman book from which it is in the main
derived, at some time earlier than the date oi the manuscript
itseli. The Sacramentades commonly known as Gallican, the

‘Missale Francorum,' the ‘Missale Gothicum,' the ‘Missale Gal·
licanum Vetus,' and possibly the ‘ Sacramentarium Gallicanum ¹,¹

show signs oi the influence of Roman books in the modification
oi the Gallican rite within the Frankish dominions: but they
give us no evidence as to the name by which the Roman books
in question were known. 'l'he Rheinau manuscript, though
rather later, and though now possessing no title, may be taken as
another instance os a Frankish Sacramentary, in the main Roman,
and based to some extent on a Sacramentary closely akin to that
from which the Vatican manuscript is derived.

ln the latter part os the eighth century, probably between 784
and 791, Pope Adrian 1 sent to Charles the Great, athis request,
acopy os the Roman Sacramentary in the shape which, as it
was believed, had been given to it by the revision of S. Gregory.
This forms the basis ol the class ol Sacramentaries known as
Gregorian, os which all the earliest specimens known to us
appear to have been written north oi the Alps. The earliest
Gregorian Sacramentaries are all divided into two parts, which
are in some manuscripts separated bya list of the conteuts os
the second part, in others also bya short prefaee to the second
part, drawn up hythe person to whose arrangement that portion
ot' the Sacramentary is to be assigned. In this preface it is
stated that the first part of the Sacramentary‚ which stands
before the preface, is (with certain specihed exceptions) the
Sacramentary set forth by S. Gregory, while the second part,
which follows the preiace, is a compilation srom other sources,
containing ‘alia quaedam quibus necessario utitur sancta ecclesia:
which S. Gregory had omitted in his Sacramentary‚ in view os
the fact that they had been already set forth by others The
second part is oi the nature, in fact, oi a supplement to the first
part, compiled irom service books other than tbat ascribed to
S. Gregory. This pretam, and therefore also the second part oi
the Gregorian Sacramentaries, are sometimes ascribed to
Grimoldus, who was Abbot os S. Gallen from about 850 to 872:
buta more probable view is that expressed by the writer os ¹the

¹bisbillon supposed this manscript 11 belongs rather to the north oi Italy.
