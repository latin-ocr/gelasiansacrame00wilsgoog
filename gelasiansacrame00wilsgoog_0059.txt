xlviii ‘ INTRODUCTION. '' '

S. Mary ad Martyres, with* the anniversarios oi'thc dedicauons
of churc'hes a't Rome: whilethe festival ol the Purification has,
as* in the RheinauMS.,‘ the title .‘ S. Simeonis! ' ’

As i'n.¹ the Rheinau MS, 'the Roman “stations’ are marked
throughout 'Lent, ior the Ember Days, andjalso lor certain
festivals. The Secret has always the title ‘Super 'oblata’ or·
‘'Super oblatam’3 .'the‘.Preface is: marked onlybythe initials:
oi ‘Vere Dignum, ’ having no separate title The Lent missae,

asin the Rheinau Sacramentary, include missac ior the Thurs·:
days ιιι 'each week.

Whether the S Gallen Sacramentary originally agreed with
that ol Rheinau in containing a ‘Liber secundus? including the
Ordo Baplirterii, and other special offices and missae such as·
those which occupy thc'latter part ol the first'fand third books
ol the Vatican MS, we cannot now says 'but it seems. not un·
lsscely that this was the case. ll so, the loss of the Liber.
saumas is the more to be regretted, since it seems that the
S. Gallen‘MS. w'as so constructed as to include forms sor the
use ol a bishop¹. It might therefore have been expected (on
the theory already stated as to the significance os the words
‘Liber secundus de extrema parte’ in the RheinauMS.)‚ that
the Liber secundus ol the S. Gallen book, ii it existed, would
have contained the forms os Ordination and other priscopal
offices, and so have fumished material lor comparison with th‘e
text ol the Vatican Sacramentary which 1s not. supplied by the
contents of the Liber securrdus oi the Rheinau book. “ -

But' in what it now contains, the S. Gallen MS. does
supply the desecte of that ol Rheinau to a very considerable
extent. As we have seen, the Proprium ..Sanctorum of the
Rheinau Sacramentary is much less lull than that ol the S. Gal-
len: and the additional missas contained in the latter cover
a very large partos the second book oi the Vatican MS. In
fact, there are only a very few sections of the Proprium Sanc,-
torum oi the Vatican Sacramentary which do not appear, either
in whole or in part, in the S. Gallen text The precise extent
os the agreement between the two will, it is hoped, be suffi-

ciently shown by the marginal references appended to the text
