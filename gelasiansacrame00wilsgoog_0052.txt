froni 9 'to 36 inclusivev contain additional matter, written by
different hands, at different times. The earliest portions are
apparently but little later than the body of the MS. while the
latest may belong to the early years of the tenth century ¹.
The Sacramentary itself is written in a hand which may be
best described as os a ‘modified Lombardic’ type, and which
seems to belong to the beginning of the ninth or the end of the
eighth century ². Traces of Lombardic writing appear also
throughout the later additions on pp. 9-30‚ though they are
less strongly marked than those which are to be found in the
sacramentary itself. In the ornamentation of the initial letters.
and in the decorative use of red dots, there may perhaps be
found some indication of Itish influence.

The spelling ol the MS. presents few peculiarities: the use of
efor ἱ is rather frequent, and there are occasional instances of
the use of o for u. But both in spelling and in grammar the
manuscript shows a much smaller proportion of errors than the
Rheinau codex. The errors which it does contain have been

generally corrected, and further emendations ol the work of
the original scribe have been made, by a second hand, probably
