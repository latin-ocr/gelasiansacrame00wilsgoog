and it seems almost ungrateful to criticise the method and
execution of a *scholar of the last century, to whom students of

Of the three principai manuscripts used by Gerbert in editing,
or compiling, the text of his Sacramentary, two, the codex
hasuugensis and Codex Sargallensrir antiquior, belonged to

the class of books known as ‘Gelasian’ The third, a inanu-

script of a peculiar character, ol which he sometimes speaks by
thetide sangallensis recentior, sometimes simply by the title
Sargallrnsis, was, when he used it, not at S. Galim, but· at
Ziirich. He calls it in one passage ‘Sangallensis olim nunc
Turicensis, ex triplici ritu Gelasiano, Gregoriano, et Ambrosiano
compositus¹.' -To this third manuscript, of much later date
