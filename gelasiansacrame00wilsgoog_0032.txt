GERBERJ‘ S T RIPLE 'SACRAMENT AR Υ. xxi

than·¹ either oi the others, Gerbert gave thevfirst place in his
estimation3 ,and it was this manuscript which he chose, rather
than either oi the other. two, as the basis oi the greater part of
his text The reason for this preference,.and.some oi its con·
sequenoes, must be very briefly stated

Gerbert considered the Codex Sangallensr‘s (S.) to be a manu·
script os the latter part os the eighth century (⁸ vix assurgit ad
mille annos'); the Codex Rhenaugr'ensis (R.) he supposed to be
earlier than S. ‘aliquot annorum decadibus? The third manu·
script was oi the tenth century, and he believed it to have heen
written at S. Gallen. It was, as has been said, a Sacramentary
of an unusual type. The compiler had had for his object the
combination in a: single volume oi the services ior the various
days oi the Church year according to the rites which were
known to him as ‘Gelasian,' ‘Gregorian,' and ‘Ambrosiam’
'In carrying out this task he appears to have used the Codex
Sangallenris (S.) as one oi his authorities, transcribing its con·
tents, or great part oi its contenta, and distinguishing as
‘Gelasian’ the portione ol his triple text which were derived
from this source ¹.

The special interest attaching to the combination os rites
presented by T. gave to that manuscriptam doubt, part oi its
special importance in Gerbert's eyes: a Sacramentary which
included« not only Gelasian iorms but also Gregorian and Am·
brosian mrlrsae ior the same days appeared to him to possess
a character oi completeness which the· older manuscripts could
not claim: but he was influenced also by other reasons He
conceived that the resemblance between R. aud. S. was so close
