It may be noted that ιιι the Rheinau MS as in the Vatican
MS. the name ‘Secreta' rs used as the heading of the prayer

M Delisle (Mlnmirerurd' ancrkns Sacramentaires ,.pp 84-6). It
is a small volume, bound ιιι stamped white sheepskin or pigskin
on oak boards, with leather clasps‚ and now contains 388
nurnbered¹ pages, including eight pages ol paper at the begin·
ning¹ and six at the end ol the volume. The paper and the
binding are both oi the same period (c. 1400), and are-perhaps
only a little earlier than the rnscription ‘Collectarium vetustum’
upon the binding.

The parchment leaves, now nurnbering184(pp.9-,376) are
arranged ιιι eighteen gatherings‚ oi which the first two appear
to be a later addition to the original volume These two
gatherings are signed at the end with the marks 1 and 11,
those which next follow being marked at the beginning as 111
and 1111, but bearing also at the end their original signatures
l and 11. The fisth gathering, and those which follow it, with
the exception ol the last ², are signed at the end with letters,
beginning with C.· The collation, summarily stated, is 'as
follows:-

NQPQ1² (Q¹² now lost).

· The original Sacramentary begins on p. 32 (i. e. on the verso
os the second lens ol' gathering 1), with an illuminated title,
filling the whole page: ‘In nomine sancte Trinitatis. Incipit
liber sacramentorum anni circulum Romane 'ecclesie’ The
recto· ol the. leal is blank· and the first leaf oi the gathering-was
probably also lest blank by the original scribe. The pages
