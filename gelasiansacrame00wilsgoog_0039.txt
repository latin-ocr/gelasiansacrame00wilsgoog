suggest a doubt whether the method of division which we find in
the Vatican manuscriptwas adopted in the Roman Sacramen-
tary used by its compiler. It seems possible that the severance
oi the Advent missae from the series contained in the first book
may have been due to a division, awkwardly carried out, os the
contents oi a Sacramentary which, like the Rheinau and
S. Gallen manuscripts, had the Proprium de Tempore and the
Proprium Sanctorum placed together in a single series, and
which¹ like the. S. Gallen manuscript ¹, described that series as
‘ordinis anni circuli,’ or ‘[per] anni circulum!

With regard to the contents oi the Proprium Samiorum we
may here notice that almost every festival included in this por·
tion nithe Vatican manuscript finds a place also in the S. Gallen
Sacramentary, and that in avery large proportion oi cases the
mosa assigned to a festival in the S. Gallen book agrees, in
whole or in part, with that which belongs to the same festival in
the Vatican manuscript The Proprium Sanctorum oi the
Rheinau manuscript is much more limited in extent, but this
also contains a good deal in common with this >portion oi the
Vatican manuscript. The presence oi messae sor the · four
festivals oi the Blessed Virgin seems to point toa date later than
the beginning os the seventh century sor the source from which
they were taken, ii this was a Roman Sacramentary²: and the
mr‘ssa ior the festival oi the Exaltation oi the Cross probably
dates from some time aiter 628.

The third book begins witha series oi missae ior Sundays, the
contents of which (except ior the fact that none oi the musae
contains a proper Preiace) correspond almost exactly with
a portion oi the series oi missae assigned in the Rheinau and
S. Gallen books to the Sundays between Pentecost and Advent.
T hen follows the Conon Actionis, with two series, one os Post·
commrinions, the other oi benedictions nuper Populum. Next
come several missae sor ordinary days3 and the remainder oi
the book is occupied by acollection os missae and prayers sor
special purposes, including forms relating to Marriage, and to the

Burial oi the Dead. The first part of this hook (the series oi
Sunday missac) is found, as has been said, in the Rheinau and
