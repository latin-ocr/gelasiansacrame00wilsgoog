by the different Sacramentaries into account, the question os
the relation ot' R. and S. to V· on the one band, aud to the
Gregorian Sacramentary on the other, will sometimes appear,
even in such cases, to be rather more intricate. 1f, in addition
to this, we further consider the lact that R. and S. contain many
missae which while they owe, or se'em to owe, some part of
their contents to the Gregorian Sacramentary, are for the most
part composed oi prayers which find no place in the first por·
tion os that Sacramentary, but can be traced in V.‚ and coutain
also other missae which are not represented in the Gregoriau
Sacramentary at all, it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion
that the type ol' Sacramentary represented by R. and ⁸8. rests,
at least to a very large extent, and probably as its principal
foundation, upon a Roman Sacramentary very closely allied to
that which lorms the basis of the text of V. On the other
hand, it can hardly be doubted that this later type oi ‘ Gelasian’
Sacramentary is closely related to that other recension oi the
Roman Sacramentary which is represented by the first portion
of Muratori's Gregorian text1.

The use which is made in R and S. of the material iumished
hythe Advent missae oi V. may be seen, to some extent, from
the notes appended to those missac (Book II, sections lxxx-
lxxxv, pp. 214-223). But it may be worth while, as an illustra·
tion oi what has been said, to examine the result, as it appears
in R. and S.‚· in comparison with the parallel portion of Mura-
tori's Gregorian text.

The two ‘Gelasian’ books contain five missae for the Sundays
belore Christmas: Muratori’s Gregorian text has only four. In
S. each of the five missas bas a Presace: the Gregorian missae
have none, and those of S. are not all contained in V. The
Collects, Secret, and Postcommunion ol the first mima in R.
aud S. are all found in V. :the two Collects are also found in
the Alias orationes de Adventu os the Gregorian text: as
regards readings, 5ι and R. preserve in one os these two Col·
lects the reading of V., in the other they agree with the
