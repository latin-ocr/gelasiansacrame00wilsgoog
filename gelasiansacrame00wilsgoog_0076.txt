SEPTUAGESIMA MISSAE OF R. ANB S. lxv

Gregorian text. and differ from V. The Socret and Postcorn·
munion are not in the Gregorian text. In the missae for the
other four Sundays R and S. agree with the Gregorian text as

to the first Collect, Secret, and Postcommunion; some of these
prayers are not contained in V. On the other hand, the second
Collect in each of the four mt‘ssae is to be found in V.. while
none of them is contained in the Gregorian text The two
‘Gelasian’ books contain a series of missae ‘quotidianis diebus’
which is not to be found either in V. or in the Gregorian text:
the greater part of the prayers of which the missae are made up
are contained in V., and most of thern are absent from the
Gregorian text. The same is the case with the series of addi-
tional Advent collecta. The missae for the Ember days, while
differing from the parallel series both in V. and in the Gregorian
text, have more in common with the former than with the latter.
There are some cases, in this portion of R. and S. of prayers in⁰
which the text of the later ‘Gelasian’ manuscripts shows agree·
ment with that of the earlier, where they differ from the Gre-
gorian text: hut the instances are few, and the points of
agreement or difference somewhat slight

The metrae of V. for septuagesima and the two following
Suadays are found in R. and S. with but little change. Each
of them has, in the later manuscripts, a proper Preface: the
Preface for Sexagesima appears elsewhere in V.‚ while all three
find a place in the supplement to the Gregorian Sacramentary,
in a form corresponding, on the whole, rather to that which is
given to them by the second hand of S. than to that in which
they are to be found in R. Apart from these Prefaces, there
is not much to connect the mhsae of R. and S. with the
Gregorian text One prayer is common to R·, S., and the
Gregorian in each of the three mt'ssae. In that for Septua-
gesima, the Super Populum of R. and S. is identical with the
Collect of the Gregorian πείσεαι it is found elsewhere in V..
which herehasno Super Populum ¹. In the metrae for Sexagesima
and Quinquagesima, R. and S. adoptas the first Collect, the
Collect of the Gregorian melrsa, and transfer to the second
place the Collect which stands first in the messa of V. This
is perhaps more to be noted in the case of the Sexagesima
