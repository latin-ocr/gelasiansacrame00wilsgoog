can influence are iew in number. First‚ perhaps, may be men-
tioned the commemoration of S. Praejectus on Jan. 25, since he
may be probably identified with the Bishop'and martyr corn·
memorated in Auvergne. Another trace ol Gallican influence
may be found in the double commemoration of S. Euphemia‚
whose name appears not only on Sept. 16, as in the Leonine
and Gregorian Sacramentaries, but also on April 13, as in the
Vatican MS. and in the Eastern Kalendars¹. Possibly the
appearance ol the names oi SS. Mary and Martha on Jan.1o,
as in the Rheinau MS., may he due to Gallican influence². On
the other hand, the correspondence with what may be said to
be known, with tolerable certainty, as to the Roman Kalendar
oi the latter part ol the eighth century is well marked, while the
great majority of the saints especiallycommemorated belong,
is not to Rome itself, at any rate to Italy.

M. Battifol, in his luminous book upon the origin and history
oi the Roman Breviary, furnishes us with a Kalendar including
the names ol those saints who may be said to have been cer·
tainly‚ or almost certainly, especially commemorated at Rome
in the time oi Adrian 1⁸. Is we compare this Kalendar with
the Proprium Sanctorum oi the S. Gallen MS., we find that the
two are in close agreement. The S. Gallen MS. omits the
mention oi S. Anastasius (Jan. 22), oi S. Matthias (Feb. 24).

omits the feasts ol S. Potentiana or Pudentiana (May 11),
S. Cyrus (July 15), S. Praxedes (July αι), and S. Apollinaris
(July 23) ⁶. It assigns the festival of S. Leo not to June 28 (the
