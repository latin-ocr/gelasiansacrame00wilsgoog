the title Liber Sacramentorum Romanae Ecclesiae. The name
of Sacramentarium Gelasionum was assigned to it, when it next
appeared in print, by Muratori, who included in his Liturgv‘a
Romana Vetus¹ a reprint of Tommasi's text, preface, and notes.
Muratori added but little of his own: but in the preface to
his whole book he declared his adhesion to Tommasi’s view of
the origin of the Sacramentary, and supported that opinion by
some further arguments. ,

The Sacramentary was published once more, a few years
later, under its former title, in the sixth volume of Vezzosi‘s
edition of the collected works of Cardinal Tommasi, which
appeared at Rome in 1751. This edition was more than a mere
reprint. It reproduced Tommasi's text, with corrections of
typographical errors, and with additional notes. These gave
the results of a new collation of the manuscript, and of a com·
parison not only with the Gregorian texts edited by Pamelius
and by Menam, which Tommasi had himself frequently cited,
but also with the Gregorian text published by Rocca, and with
the Codex Ottobonianus. This last authority, a Gregorian Sacra-
mentary, had been partly made known by Muratori, and had
been examined by Tommasi, after the publication of his Codices
sacramenrorum. Another source of additionalnotes was found
in a copy of Tommasi’s work in which the editor had himself

made manuscript additions and corrections (including observa·
tions as to the readings of the Codex ottobonianus), possibly
with a view to a new edition. The more important of these
memoranda were incorporated by Vezzosi with the notes of

Tommasi's own edition, being distinguished by asterisks from
the earlier notes. Thus Vezzosi's edition is the most complete
of those which have hitherto appeared 23 but since its publica·
tion some further means have become available for the critical
study of the text.

When Tommasi published his editio princeps, the Vatican
manuscript stood by itself. It was, professedly‚ a Roman Sacra·
mentary: but while it contained a good many things in common
with the Roman Sacramentaries of the ‘Gregorian' type, it
differed very widely from these later books not only in date,
