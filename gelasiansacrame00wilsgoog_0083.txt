lxxii INTRODUCYION.

missa assigned to the same day in V., and in ignoring the totally
different missa provided for it (as the Sunday following the

Pentecost Ember days) in the first portion of the Gregorian
Sacramentary. ¹For the Sunday following, they adopt the missa
which V. assigns to the sixth Sunday ‘post clausurn Paschae?
This missa also furnishes‚ in the supplementary part of Mura-
tori's text, the Collect, Secret aud Postcommunion which make
up the Gregorian mirso for what is there called the first Sunday
after Pentecost1. But lt is to be observed that R and S. take
the whole messa, including the Super Populum, as it stands in
V., so that this Sundayis in R. and S. provided with a Super
Populum, a feature which iswanting in their remaining musae
for the Sundays after the Octave of Pentecost. The next
Sunday mosa of R and S. agrees with that for the Sunday
after the Ascension² in V., save for the omission of the Super
Populum: the parallel missa in Muratori’s text has the same
Collect, Secret‚ and Postcommunion. Next come, in R. and S.,
three missae to which V. does not contain any parallel The
first Collect, Secret, and Postcommunion in each case agree with
the corresponding missa in Muratori‘s text. One of the second
Collects is found elsewhere in the supplementary part of the
Gregorian Sacramentary; the two others have not been identi-
fied either in that Sacramentary or in V. A few of the prayers
of these three missae are found in V., and three, not contained
in V., are found in the first portion of the Gregorian sacra-
mentary.

With the seveuth Sunday after Pentecost in R and S, or the
sixth Sunday after Pentecost, according to Muratori’s text, we
reach a set of missae corresponding on the whole to the first
part of the series contained ,in the third book of V. As
a general rule R. and S. take, in these missae, the whole mr‘ssa
given in V., adding a Preface‚ while the Gregorian text simply
discards the second Collect of V., R. and S. ; but in afew cases
R. and S. substitute for the Secret or Postcommunion of V.

agree In two cases the Gregorian text discards the first
