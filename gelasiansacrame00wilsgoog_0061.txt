cases their evidence may be set aside in favour ol that supplied
by earlier authorities, such as the ‘Leonine' Sacramentary‚ it
must ontweigh that ol the later Sacramentaries ofthe‘ Gregorian'
type, such as those edited by Pamelius or Menard to which, as
the best authorities accessible in their time, Tommasi and Vezzosi
were naturally led to refer.

IV. The Bodleian MS. Bodl. Add. A. 173 has been occasion·
ally cited in the notes to the present volume, where itis denoted
by the symbol Α. This manuscript also is described by

M. Delisle¹, lrom notes lumished by Mr. Falconer Madau. It
is a small volume containing fifty-two parchment leaves, not
unisorm in size. It is written in a Carolingian minuscule hand

which may be assigned to a date near the end of the ninth cen·
tury. The phrase ‘Christianum Francorum Romanorumque
imperium' in the Good Friday prayers, maybe taken as evidence
that it was written in the F rankish kingdom, but there is nothing
else in the manuscript itsell to show clearly the place where it
was written or used. lt may be said to consist os four fragments,
each incomplete at the beginning and at the end, while there
are also several gaps in the first and fourth fragments. The
missae contained in this manuscript are ol the Gregorian, not ol
the Gelasian type: but in some portions ol its contents it
presents certain points ol interest ior the purpose of the present
edition. The peculiar form in which the Creed which it contains
was written by the original scribe shows several curious instances
of agreement with the text ol the Vatican manuscript: and cer-
tain portione ol the forms relating to Ordination, which make up
one of the fragments ², show a text closely agreeing with that ol
the Codex Gellonensis, as cited by Martene.

V. Another Bodleian manuscript, formerly included in the
Canonici collection, now MS. Liturg. Miscell. 319, has also
lumished some material lor the notes os this edition, where it
is cited by the symbol B. Itis prolessedlyaGregorianSacra·

certain Aquileian saints ⁸, and notices os the obits os six Patri·
