the supplement to the Gregorian Sacramentary) are called
‘Orationes Dominicales S. Gelasii Papae ¹.’ Another instance
of the same kind of reference is to be found in the Irish book
known as the Stowe Missal, where the Canon is entitled ⁴ Canon
Dominicus Papae Gilasi².'

We have already seen that Le Brun speaks of several ‘Gelasian’
Sacramentaries as known to him : and the points which he notes
as distinguishing thern from the Gregorian Sacramentaries may
be sufficiently traced in R and S. to warrant us in supposing
that these two manuscripts, if not among those with which
Le Brun was acquainted, belong to the same type which he
distinguished as ‘Gelasian' He does not notice any Sacra·
mentary divided, like the Vatican manuscript, into three books,
and we may perhaps fairly infer that he knew of none, except
the Vatican manuscript, in which this division was to be found
The manuscripts of the ‘Gelasian’ type now known to us are few
in number. Besides R. and S., it would seem that we may
assign to this class the Sacramentary of Gellone, from which
Martene extracted several of the Ordines included in his work
De Antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus, and to which, as reproduced by
Martene, reference is occasionally made in the following pages⁸ 3
and also amanuscript now known as Codex O. 83 in the Chapter
Library ol Prague⁴. To the same class, perhaps, belongs the
Sacramentary of Angouleme, described by M. Delisle 5; but this
