S. Martin in the 'lCommuni'cantes’ clause ol the· Canon. li
M. Duchesne's suggestion las to the origin ot-the‘two forms
which appear at the end of the Missa Clarismulis⁸ in the Vatican'
MS.1 is correct, we must reckon’ their:appearance in the S. Gal:
len MS.¹ as a sign ol possibleGallican influence. Th'e form
oi blessing the Paschal candle is the same as that which appears
in the Gallican books, but it is probable that this torm, as well
as th'e usage ⁴os thebenediction, had already found its way into
Italy before the end oi the eighth century. ‘The form ior blessa ·
ing the lamb atthe close of the Canon in the Missa in Nocte
Sancta. (see Gerb. p. 90) illustrates a custom which, thou'gh‘
probably not general, was apparently sufficiently common in
the middle of the ninth century to furnish Photius with one oi
his accusations against the Western Church23 and its presence
in the manuscript, though showing that the latter was adapted,
in this respect, to local custom, gives no sure indication as
to any particular locality. ’

Οιι the other hand, the absence oi any-notice oi the Rogation
Days may be taken as evidence that the Gallican influence was
not strong in the district to which¹ the manuscript belongs⁸z
while the presence ol the prayers ior the Great Litany of
April 25, with mention oi the Roman ‘stations,' points to the
following, in this respect, of the Roman custom A similai
inierenoe may be drawn from the list oi saints mentioned in the
Proprium Sanctorum. Here also it would appear that Roman,
rather than Gallican, usage has determined the local practice,
and influenced the local kalendar.
